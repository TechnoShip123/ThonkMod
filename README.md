# Thonk Mod
![Mod Logo](https://github.com/TechnoShip123/ThonkMod/blob/v1.16.5/src/main/resources/logo.png)

### About
ThonkMod is a simple mod by me to learn my way around modding [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) using
the [Forge MDK](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/).

### Playing
To use the mod, go to the [latest releases](https://github.com/TechnoShip123/ThonkMod/releases/latest) and download the mod `.jar`,
listed under assets. It should be `thonkmod-X.X.X-forge.jar`. Once you download it, make sure you have the [Forge Modloader](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/) already installed.
If you have played it before it should have generated a `mods` folder in your `.minecraft` directory. Drag the ThonkMod `.jar` file into the mods folder, and
start Minecraft in the launcher. Make sure to select whatever profile is associated with Forge.

### License
See the license in the main repository branch for details.
